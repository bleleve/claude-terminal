/**
 * Pauses every infinite CSS animation while the window is unfocused.
 *
 * A composited animation forces the compositor to produce a frame on every
 * vsync, and the per-frame cost grows with the size of the document: measured
 * on a 68k-node transcript, a single 13px spinner costs ~30% of a core, and
 * eleven of them cost barely more than one. All the perpetual animations in
 * the app are "still working" indicators (spinners, status-dot pulses, the
 * streaming cursor, the dancing mascot), so freezing them while the user is
 * in another app changes nothing they can act on.
 *
 * Why not CSS, globally? `.background-paused` in base.css already pauses
 * everything on `visibilitychange`, but macOS only reports the document hidden
 * when the window is minimized or fully occluded, and a visible-but-unfocused
 * window keeps burning. Extending that class to blur would also pause *entry*
 * animations, and `chat-msg-in` starts at opacity 0: messages streamed into an
 * unfocused-but-visible window would render invisible.
 *
 * ── Why this no longer calls document.getAnimations() ───────────────────────
 *
 * It used to, on every blur and on a 100ms debounce after any animation start
 * while blurred. That call is superlinear in document size. Measured in this
 * app's own document, on the machine it ships to:
 *
 *      786 nodes        0 ms
 *    20786 nodes      534 ms
 *    80786 nodes   13 400 ms
 *   200786 nodes   97 000 ms
 *
 * A transcript of the size this module was written for therefore paid ~13 s of
 * frozen main thread *per blur*, which is the "I switch to another app, come
 * back, and the UI is stuck" report. Worse, `animationstart` re-armed the
 * sweep 100ms after each new spinner, so a session left streaming in the
 * background ran 13-second sweeps back to back for as long as it was away.
 * That is where a renderer pegged at a full core for days comes from.
 *
 * So nothing here walks the document any more. An element announces itself
 * through `animationstart`, we read *that element's* computed style to decide
 * whether it is perpetual, and we keep the handful that are. Both the tracking
 * and the pause are then bounded by the number of live spinners rather than by
 * the number of nodes on screen.
 *
 * Pausing is a class rather than `Animation.pause()` for the same reason: the
 * class is applied per element, only to elements whose animations are *all*
 * infinite, so it carries none of the objection that ruled out the global one.
 * It also avoids the spec wrinkle that pause()/play() detaches an animation's
 * play state from `animation-play-state`.
