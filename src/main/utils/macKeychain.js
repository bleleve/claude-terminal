/**
 * The macOS login Keychain, reached the way the Claude CLI reaches it.
 *
 * The CLI reads and writes its credential items through /usr/bin/security, so
 * that binary is the application every item's access list trusts. Reading the
 * same items in-process (keytar, i.e. the Security framework inside Electron)
 * makes this app the requester instead, and it is not on that list: macOS asks
 * for the login password. "Always Allow" does not hold either. It pins the
 * app's code signature, and an ad-hoc signed build gets a new one with every
 * update, so each release brought the dialog back once per item, every five
 * minutes, for as long as it went unanswered.
 *
 * Going through the same binary as the CLI makes these reads silent whatever
 * the app is signed with. Same surface as keytar (getPassword / setPassword /
 * deletePassword), so callers and their test doubles do not change shape.
 *
 * This is for items the CLI owns. The app's own secrets (GitHub token, Groq key)
 * stay on keytar: the app created them, so it is on their access list, and
 * only a stable signing identity would keep it there across updates.
